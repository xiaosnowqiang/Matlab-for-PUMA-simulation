# Matlab-for-PUMA-simulation
This is my first demo for learning Robotics.
It mainly includes the kinematics simulation of the puma robot.


I have made some modifications based on this demo：https://github.com/PascPeli/Puma-Robot-Simulation.

(1)  The GUI can read easily because it has been modified to Chinese.

(2)  Added some button controls to enrich the demonstration.Including record Joint motion and replay,
simple visual control and gesture interaction based on leap motion controller.
 
(3)  Using leap motion controller to control the robot you should first read this：https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_39090239/article/details/82389854 (Chinses)，then you will know how the leap motion can communicationwith MATLAB.The MatLeap you can find on this web:https://github.com/jeffsp/matleap
